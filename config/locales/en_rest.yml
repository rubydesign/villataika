    eco:
      short: Ecological energy.
      rest: Villa Taika now uses only renewable enery <br/>
            We have installed a new wood heating sytem. A modern wood gasification stove now produces most of the
            energy neeeded. But also a water circulating fireplace contributes to the heating of the house. <br/>
            Additionally we installed a very energy efficient heat pump in our breakfast lounge.<br/>
            The electricity powering the pump, and indeed the whole house is 100% renwable, like wind and
            water power, bought from Kraft and Kultur.
